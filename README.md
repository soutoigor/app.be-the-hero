![Be the Hero](https://i.ibb.co/qd6LgbY/logo-3x.png)

A React Native app that you can find NGOs with the [Be the Hero API](https://github.com/soutoigor/api.be-the-hero) and contact the NGOs to make a donate.  
This application was made following the bootcamp "Semana Omnistack 11" from [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), we this project I could learn some concepts like **infinite pagination**, Access **E-mail** and **WhatsApp**, and some styling tips.
